I am a third-year undergraduate student in the [College of Letters & Science](https://ls.wisc.edu/)at the[University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). Before I attend UW-Madison, I was at the[Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/)at the[University of Massachusetts,Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). Currently, I am in triple major, which are Computer Science, Economics and Mathematics.
My research interests include trustworthy machine learning, Generative Artificial Intelligence especially (Multimodal) Large Language Models, prompt engineering, privacy, digital security and tranditional system security.
I am also interested in computational social science(since my secondary major is economics, and before I decided my major at UMass, I was actually on the opposite of science majors, I was a political science major!), which includes using maachine learning techniques to solve real world economic,political science and Sociology problems.

You can find my CV here[Minyuan Zhu's CV](../assets/Minyuan_Zhu_s_CV.pdf).
